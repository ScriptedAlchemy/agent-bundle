# Repository guidance

## Workbench platform scope

- The developer Workbench is a desktop-only application.
- Design, implementation, and browser acceptance should target desktop viewports and desktop interaction patterns.
- Do not add mobile-specific layouts, responsive behavior, or mobile acceptance requirements unless the user explicitly requests them.
- A mobile-only layout defect is not a release blocker for this repository.

## Public examples

- Treat `examples/*` as user-facing products, not test fixtures.
- Use only public `agent-bundle` package exports and `workspace:*` dependencies.
- Validate examples at a 1440×900 desktop viewport; mobile support is not required.
- Never accept or capture a Workbench route while its loading state is still visible.
- Browser acceptance must cover populated state plus the documented stale-diagnostic and repair flow.

## Vendored repos

- `repos/` is **read-only reference material**. Do not edit, format, or import from `repos/**`.
- Application code imports the published npm package (`effect`), never a path under `repos/`.
- Before writing Effect code, read `repos/effect/LLMS.md` and the linked
  `agent-patterns/effect-{stream,scope,concurrency,errors}.md`.
- Editor search, file watching, and auto-import exclude `repos/**`
  (`.vscode/settings.json`). Subtree updates ride the same named chore as
  the Effect RC re-pin — see `docs/effect-conventions.md`.
