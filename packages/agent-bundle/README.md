# agent-bundle

Compile a typed Agent Bundle configuration into portable, Codex, and Claude Code artifacts. Node.js 22.19 or later is required.

```sh
npm install --save-dev agent-bundle
agent-bundle dev --root .
agent-bundle build --root . --output artifact
```

The package supports source `inspect`, source or artifact `validate`, local artifact MCP list/invoke, artifact hook list/simulate, and ordinary local development:

```sh
agent-bundle dev --root .
```

`inspect` reads source configuration; use `validate --artifact artifact` for source-free artifact validation. `dev.runtime.provider` is an advanced optional extension: a normal project starts the dev server and Workbench without loading an RSC provider.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent-bundle build` | Build a validated artifact from source. |
| `agent-bundle validate` | Validate project source, or an artifact with `--artifact`. |
| `agent-bundle inspect` | Inspect normalized targets and adapter plans from source. |
| `agent-bundle mcp list` / `mcp invoke` | List or invoke one MCP tool from an artifact. |
| `agent-bundle hooks list` / `hooks simulate` | List generated hooks, or run one emitted wrapper. |
| `agent-bundle eval` | Run deterministic or native Claude/Codex eval suites and record a run. |
| `agent-bundle dev` | Serve the packaged developer workbench on loopback. |

`validate --artifact`, `mcp`, and `hooks` work against a built artifact with project sources deleted.

## Developer workbench

`agent-bundle dev` serves a loopback-only prebuilt workbench with project diagnostics and Skills,
artifact provenance, artifact-bound MCP and hook playgrounds, durable ordered playground traces, and
eval runs and comparisons. Hook and MCP operations can record into an open playground trace for export
or promotion into a draft eval case.

## Evaluation

Eval suites are typed modules discovered by convention:

```ts
import { defineEvalSuite, expectExitCode } from 'agent-bundle/eval';
```

Assertions resolve to `pass`, `fail`, or `inconclusive`; insufficient evidence is never silently
passed. Fewer than three trials is smoke evidence, and comparisons label unrecorded alignment facets
as unverified.

## Authentication and limitations

This package never accepts, requests, injects, or persists a model-provider API key. Native Claude and
Codex harnesses use an already installed signed-in CLI after provider-key environment variables are
removed. Native smoke tests are opt-in; Codex Skill-activation evidence is inferred, not observed.
Semantic model-backed grading/configuration is explicitly refused, and raw HTML, JSX/MDX, and Mermaid
in Skill Markdown are inert in the workbench renderer.

Top-level `scripts` is a record of stable output names to an entry path or `{ entry, targets? }`. JavaScript/TypeScript entries bundle to `scripts/<name>.mjs`; `.sh`, `.bash`, and `.py` entries copy byte-for-byte while preserving source modes. The generated `agent-bundle.manifest.json` records file digests for stable artifact validation.

`AgentBundleConfig` merges bundled portable, Codex, and Claude declarations
through `AgentBundleConfigExtensions`. `TargetRegistry` owns the unique
extension descriptor and adapter for each target. Ordinary projects need no
extension key; extension values are strict finite JSON and host-specific values
stay in their adapter. Add a host by registering an adapter and exporting/merging
its interface instead of adding raw compiler or Runtime parsing. ChatGPT/OpenAI
and Claude Workbench simulation profiles are not configuration-extension claims.

The package publishes no example RSC provider, host credentials, or native-host
evaluation integration. See the repository's
[optional RSC Runtime topology](../../docs/architecture/rsc-runtime-workbench.md)
for the explicit example-owned boundary.

Third-party notices, including the vendored MCP Inspector snapshot's license and provenance, ship in
the published package.
